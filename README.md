ðŸ‘‹ Hi, 

Iâ€™m @noobiecoderjohn aka Johnny Zeng and I'm a Software Developer ðŸ’» and a Information Systems student currently attending
CUNY SPS in the New York Metropolitan area ðŸŽ“. My passion for software lies with thinking of useful and innovative ideas
and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I have gone through and completed YearUp's bootcamp for Software development for 6
months which is where I started my journey in software development. I have learned a lot from the program and am now learning different
technologies for other tech stacks.

ðŸ“« I've listened a couple of contacts below on how to reach me!
